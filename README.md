## Future Improvements
For now, in this project, traditional client-side JavaScript is minimal as React (a JavaScript library) handles most of the dynamic aspects of the website. This approach allows for a more organized and modular development process, focusing on components rather than separate JavaScript files for interactivity.

- Add a contact form for customer inquiries.
- Implement user authentication for reservations and online orders.
- Enhance animations and transitions for better UX.
